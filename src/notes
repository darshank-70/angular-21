== multiple ways of routing into a specific route. 
    * Template -> routerLink directive [routerLink="/login"]
    * Programmatic -> this.router.navigate(['/login'])
== lazy Loading
    * To Reduce the initial Bundle size and improve performance.
    * First root bundle loads and then on Route match the lazy loading happens and component renders
== Standalone Components.
    * Component are not standalone by default. 
    * Component cannot exist without a ng module in previous version, from angular 15+ standalone is introduced.
    * a standalone component can exist without and module 
    * a standalone component can import dependencies on own.
    * can be routed directly to the component.
== Angular Gaurds.
    * ROuting decides to route to the specific path or component.
    * but gaurd decides whether to route to that path or component
    * Mainly used for Authentication, Authorization (Roles) 
    * Types of Gaurds
      - Can Activate 
      - can match
      - can deactivate
      - resolve
      - can load (legacy) -> replaced by canMatch
      Modern angular uses Function Based gaurds not the old way like class Based 
    * Can Match is recommended because it is more efficient because it runs before lazy loading.
    * can activate will load the module but doesnt route, but can match will not even load module if gaurd is not satisfied.
    *
